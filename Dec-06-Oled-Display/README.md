# Day 6 - OLED Screen

This one was good fun. We used the upward-pointing i2c header pins for this
instead of the regular breadboard pins. Same thing, but it made more sense for
me to tell the kids to connect SDA to SDA etc rather than some seemingly random
gpio pin.

We did the logo bitmap first, just to see it working. Next up we used the
stamps to display built-in 5x5 images. We played around with making them move
back and forth across the screen.

After that we put some text on the screen. I let the kids figure out for
themselves how to lay it out.

Later on I pulled out a couple of pots, and made a simple etch-a-sketch, which
worked surprisingly well.
