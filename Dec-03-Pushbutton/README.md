# Day 3 - Pushbutton

https://www.littlebird.com.au/learn/93/push-button-with-micro-bit

First of all we connected up the green led and the 220R resistor, and turned
that on when the button was pressed. The kids seemed quite taken with the
immediacy of it.

Next we switched the code to display different faces on the led matrix,
depending on whether the button was pushed or not. This was heaps of fun.

I wanted to stress that the name of the variable we used made no difference to
the computer, and was only for human purposes. After a few minutes squabbling,
they decided on bigbamboo.
