# Day 5 - Potentiometer

Yesterday's session ran a bit long, so today we kept it short. Don't want to be
burning the kids out just yet.

We made the dimmmer thing with the led and the pot. I'd had plans to plug the
four-digit display back in and write the values out to that. Instead, we printed
the values out and looked at them in the Mu plotter window.

We started by just printing out the value, and then switched to printing both
the value and its negative. "Drawing" on the plotter by turning the knob was
kinda fun. This might be a fun thing to do with the oled display - use two pots
and make an etch-a-sketch.
