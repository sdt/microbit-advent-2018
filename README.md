# Little Bird Micro:Bit Advent Kit 2018

I'm teaching my 8 and 10 year old kids a little programming with the [Little Bird Micro:Bit Advent Kit 2018](https://www.littlebird.com.au/little-bird-micro-bit-advent-kit-2018) and [MicroPython](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) using the [Mu Editor](https://codewith.mu/).

Little Bird have provided an excellent series of daily tutorials, which use the [Micro:Bit MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) system. I'm following the same tutorials, but switching over to MicroPython once we've completed the physical build steps.

I'm very impressed with this kit. For AUD$80, it's tremendous value.
