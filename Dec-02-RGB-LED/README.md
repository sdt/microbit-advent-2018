# Day 2 - Use an RGB LED Module with micro:bit

https://www.littlebird.com.au/learn/63/make-an-rgb-led-blink-with-micro-bit

The kids were out yesterday, so we actually did day one this morning. I didn't
want to overload them, so for this one we extended the previous days code by
adding a new `blue` parameter to our `set_colour` function from yesterday, and
then played around with combining colours.

I suspect this might work better with some sort of diffuse cover on the LED.
When we turned on red and blue together, we tended to see a red dot and a blue
dot, rather than purple.
